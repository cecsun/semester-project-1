# Semester Project 1

## Description

The semester project should reflect my creative and technical knowledge and skills based on the first-semester curriculum. The assignment was to create an informative and engaging website for an interactive museum called the Community Science Museum. Its core target audience is children (ages 7-15) and families with young children. Firstly, I collected media assets I was provided with the assignment, which was text for the website and images. I found a few other high quality images from free stock sites, and resized all the images to avoid bad user experience on the finished website. I decided to design a logo for the website by using text and an icon from Figma, which I think gives a good reflection of what kind of a museum the Community Science Museum is. The content is placed hierarchically and the navigation of the website makes it easy to comprehend for the target audience, with a pleasing use of a color palette that displays over the various pages of the site. I developed the website using html and css, where the html of the site is semantic and the css follows the DRY principle. Working on this project I have taken under consideration the principles for usage of color and text. I have developed the site with a font and size that makes it readable, and the use of color gives the user an understanding of the pages hierarchy. The use of meta tags and alt text gives a description of what the topic of the page consists of, which makes it easier for the user to grasp the content of the website.
